## Vanilla PWA

Is it possible to write a Progressive Web App without using any library, framework and build tool? **Yes, it is**, and that's exactly what Vanilla PWA is. Of course it isn't meant to be used for an important project, since only a few browsers support the technologies used to build it, but it is a great way to understand how the great things modern frameworks provide work.

These are the native modern technologies used in this PWA:

- [HTML Templates](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element)
- [Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html)
- [Shadow DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees)
- [ES Modules](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-module-system)
- [Service Worker](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker)
- [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org)
- [Notifications API](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org)
- [Storage API (more specifically the Cache API)](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org)
