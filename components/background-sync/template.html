  <h1>Background sync</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    This page allows you to send a POST request to a mock backend. The POST request won't be directly
    executed by the website, but it will use the Background Sync API to tell the Service Worker
    to execute it when possible. When the POST request is made, the server will do some mock heavy, asynchronous
    operations that will take random time between 0 and 5 seconds. A push notification will be sent to
    advise the user that everything went ok as soon as these operations have been completed.
    This approach allows us to build a seamless experience for the user, that is able to send
    the request and then close the website, even if the request hasn't been executed yet.
  </p>
  <p>First of all, press the button below to enable notifications</p>
  <div class="center-content">
    <button id="notifications-button"></button>
  </div>
  <p>Then, press the button below to send a POST request to the back end</p>
  <div class="center-content">
    <button id="post-button"></button>
  </div>
  <p>
    You should receive a notification when the POST request has been received and handled by the server.<br>
    To better understand how background sync works, you might also want to go offline,
    press the button to send the POST request, close the website and go back online. You will receive
    the notification as soon as the synchronization happens in the background.
